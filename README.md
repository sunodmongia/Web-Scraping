# Web-Scraping

In this repository I used jupyter notebook with python kernal for scraping HTML and CSS of any website and saving it to your local PC. Both HTML and CSS file are saved separately.

Python Library used:
  --> Beautifulsoup from bs4 (from bs4 import BeautifulSoup)
  --> request
  --> csv
  --> urljoin from urllib.parse (import urllib.parse import urljoin)

  This can be used on any website for scarping only.
